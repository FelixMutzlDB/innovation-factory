CAMPAIGN: FLEET CUSTOMER ONBOARDING PROCESS
ASM Cockpit Customer Relations
Process Document | Ongoing Program

OVERVIEW
New fleet customer onboarding ensures a smooth transition to ASM fueling, maximizes early volume, and establishes the foundation for a long-term relationship. Poor onboarding correlates with early churn and volume shortfall. This process applies to all new fleet contracts.

ONBOARDING BONUS
- Mechanic: 500 bonus loyalty points credited to new fleet account in first month
- Eligibility: New fleet contracts signed from 1 January 2025
- Timing: Points credited upon first 1,000 liters dispensed
- Purpose: Incentivize rapid activation; reward early adoption
- Budget: Approximately 50 EUR equivalent per new account
