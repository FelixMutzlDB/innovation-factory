COMMON ISSUES AND RESOLUTION

Brush Not Making Contact
- Cause: Brush wear, incorrect height setting, vehicle positioning
- Action: Adjust height per vehicle type; replace brush if worn
- Check: Brush pressure setting

Streaking or Poor Dry
- Cause: Drying agent low, air knife fault, water spots
- Action: Refill drying agent; check air knife operation; verify rinse cycle complete
- Water quality: Hard water may cause spotting - consider softener

Payment Terminal Not Accepting
- Cause: Network, card reader fault, pricing error
- Action: Verify network; clean card reader; check price configuration
- Bypass: Manual payment with code - document

Machine Stops Mid-Cycle
- Cause: Obstruction, safety sensor, overload
- Action: Check for obstacle; reset safety; verify no vehicle contact with structure
- Emergency stop: Release, power cycle, retry

Water Not Dispensing
- Cause: Frozen line (winter), clogged filter, pump fault
- Action: Check for freeze; replace filter; verify pump operation
- Winter: Heat trace and insulation critical

Noise or Vibration
- Cause: Loose components, bearing wear, misalignment
- Action: Tighten mounts; schedule bearing replacement; technician for alignment

WINTER OPERATIONS
- Bay heating: Maintain above freezing
- Chemical: Some products have cold-weather variants
- Hose: Drain when not in use in extreme cold
- Ice: Clear bay entrance; salt per local procedure

SAFETY
- Never enter bay when machine operating
- Emergency stop: Clearly marked, tested weekly
- Vehicle secure: Ensure vehicle in park, brake applied
- Customer communication: Clear instructions at entrance
