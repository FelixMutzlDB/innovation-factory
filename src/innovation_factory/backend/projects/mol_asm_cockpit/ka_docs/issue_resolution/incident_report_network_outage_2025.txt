INCIDENT REPORT: ISP OUTAGE - MULTI-STATION IMPACT
Date: 8 February 2025
Incident ID: INC-2025-00234
Classification: Infrastructure / Business Continuity

SUMMARY
A fiber cut affecting the primary ISP (Magyar Telekom) caused connectivity loss at 12 ASM stations in the Budapest and Pest region between 09:15 and 14:45. Stations failed over to 4G backup connectivity. POS and fuel operations continued with degraded functionality. No station was forced to close.

AFFECTED STATIONS
HU-BP-001, HU-BP-003, HU-BP-007, HU-BP-012, HU-PE-002, HU-PE-005, HU-PE-008, HU-PE-011, HU-PE-014, HU-PE-017, HU-PE-019, HU-PE-022

TIMELINE
09:15 - First station (HU-BP-001) reported connectivity loss
09:18 - Second station reported; pattern identified
09:25 - Regional IT confirmed ISP outage, initiated failover procedures
09:30-10:45 - Stations manually switched to 4G backup (varies by station)
10:00 - ISP confirmed fiber cut, estimated repair 4-6 hours
14:45 - Primary connectivity restored to all stations
15:30 - Stations switched back to primary; 4G confirmed as standby

IMPACT ASSESSMENT

Fuel Operations
- Card payments: Intermittent during failover - some transactions required retry
- Fleet cards: Delayed authorization on 4G - average 8 second delay vs 2 second normal
- Cash payments: Unaffected
- Tank monitoring: ATG continued via 4G; no data loss

POS and Shop
- Card transactions: 15-20 second processing time on 4G vs 3-5 second normal
- Some transactions timed out - manual entry required
- Back-office sync: Delayed; reconciled after restoration
- No transaction data loss

CCTV and Security
- Recording continued on local storage
- Remote viewing unavailable during outage
- No security incidents reported

FAILOVER PROCEDURE (Documented for Future Reference)
1. Confirm primary connectivity lost (ping test to gateway)
2. Activate 4G router - typically automatic failover at most stations
3. For manual stations: Switch network cable from primary to 4G router
4. Verify POS can process test transaction
5. Verify pump authorization working
6. Log failover time in ASM Cockpit
7. Monitor 4G data usage - alert if approaching limit

LESSONS LEARNED
- 4G backup adequate for continued operations
- Failover time varied: Stations with automatic failover recovered in 2-5 minutes; manual stations 15-45 minutes
- Recommendation: Upgrade remaining 4 manual-failover stations to automatic
- 4G data caps: One station (HU-PE-022) approached monthly limit; consider higher tier

COST IMPACT
- Lost sales: Estimated 2,400 EUR across 12 stations (customers left due to slow transactions)
- Overtime: 180 EUR (IT support)
- No equipment damage
