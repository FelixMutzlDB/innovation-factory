Document Version: 2.1 | Last Updated: February 2025

OVERVIEW
Effective complaint handling protects customer relationships and provides operational feedback. Unresolved complaints escalate to regional office, fleet account managers, or social media - with greater cost and reputational impact. This procedure ensures consistent, professional response.

STANDARD COMPLAINT HANDLING PROCESS

Step 1: Listen and Acknowledge
- Allow customer to explain fully without interruption
- Show empathy: "I understand your frustration"
- Do not become defensive or blame other staff/systems
- Take notes: Key facts, customer name, contact, transaction details if applicable

Step 2: Apologize and Take Responsibility
- Apologize for the inconvenience - even if cause unclear
- "I'm sorry you experienced this" - not necessarily admitting fault
- Avoid: "I'm sorry you feel that way" (dismissive)
- Use: "Thank you for bringing this to our attention"

Step 3: Clarify and Investigate
- Ask clarifying questions to understand fully
- For product issues: Retain product if possible, note batch/lot
- For service issues: Note time, staff involved, specific failure
- For billing: Gather receipt, transaction reference, account details
- Do not promise resolution before investigation when cause unclear

Step 4: Resolve
- Resolve at lowest level possible - station staff for most issues
- Options: Refund, replacement, discount, goodwill gesture
- Authority limits: Staff 50 EUR, Supervisor 100 EUR, Manager 250 EUR
- Document: Resolution offered and accepted
- Follow up: If promised callback, do it within committed timeframe

Step 5: Document and Report
- Log in ASM Cockpit: Customer Complaints module
- Include: Date, customer, issue, resolution, staff
- Retain for 2 years minimum
- Trend analysis: Regional office reviews for patterns
