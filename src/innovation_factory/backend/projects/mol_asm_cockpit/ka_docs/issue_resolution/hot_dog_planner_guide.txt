HOT DOG PRODUCTION PLANNING GUIDE
ASM Cockpit Service Station Network
Document Version: 1.5 | Last Updated: January 2025

PURPOSE
Optimize hot dog production to meet customer demand while minimizing waste. Hot dogs are a high-margin Fresh Corner product but have limited hold time (4 hours on roller). Over-production leads to waste; under-production loses sales and customer satisfaction.

BATCH SIZES BY TIME OF DAY

Early Morning (05:00-08:00)
- Initial batch: 6-8 units (depending on station size)
- Replenishment: Add 2-3 every 45 minutes
- Rationale: Commuter traffic building; avoid large batch that may exceed hold time before lunch peak

Morning (08:00-11:00)
- Batch size: 4-6 units per replenishment
- Frequency: Every 30-40 minutes
- Rationale: Steady demand; smaller batches ensure freshness

Lunch Peak (11:00-14:00)
- Batch size: 10-15 units per replenishment
- Frequency: Every 20-25 minutes
- High-volume stations (HU-BP-001, HR-ZG-003): Consider 15-20 unit batches
- Rationale: Maximum demand period; larger batches reduce replenishment frequency during rush

Afternoon (14:00-17:00)
- Batch size: 4-6 units
- Frequency: Every 45 minutes
- Rationale: Demand decline; avoid excess inventory

Evening (17:00-20:00)
- Batch size: 6-10 units
- Frequency: Every 30 minutes
- Rationale: Second smaller peak; commuter and traveler traffic

Late Night (20:00-05:00)
- Batch size: 2-4 units
- Frequency: Every 60-90 minutes
- 24-hour stations only; reduce or discontinue at stations closing before midnight

STATION-SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS
- Highway stations: Increase lunch and evening batches by 20-30%
- Urban stations: More consistent demand; smaller variance between periods
- Truck stop stations: Larger batches throughout; truck drivers often buy 2-3 units
- Tourist route stations: Seasonal adjustment; summer +25% to all batches

WASTE REDUCTION STRATEGIES

1. Demand Tracking
- Log actual sales vs. production daily in ASM Cockpit
- Review weekly waste reports; adjust batch sizes for next week
- Target waste rate: Below 5% of production

2. Promotional Alignment
- When running hot dog promotion: Increase batches by 40% for promoted hours only
- Post-promotion: Return to standard for 2 days to clear any overstock

3. End-of-Day Procedure
- Stop production 2 hours before closing
- Final batch: Size for expected remaining customers only
- Document unsold units; discard per food safety protocol

4. Weather and Events
- Rainy days: Reduce batches 15-20% (fewer customers)
- Local events: Increase if station near event venue
- Holiday periods: Reference seasonal_operations_guide.txt

PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS
- Standard sausage: 100g unit
- Jumbo option: 150g unit - produce 30% fewer units, same batch timing
- Vegetarian option: Separate roller; batch size 50% of meat equivalent

REPORTING
Daily waste and production data feeds ASM Cockpit analytics. Station managers review monthly to refine station-specific parameters.
