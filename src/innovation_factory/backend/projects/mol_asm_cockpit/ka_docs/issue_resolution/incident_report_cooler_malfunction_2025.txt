INCIDENT REPORT: WALK-IN COOLER TEMPERATURE ALARM
Station: HR-C-002 (Croatia, Zagreb area)
Date: 22 January 2025
Incident ID: INC-2025-00189
Classification: Equipment Failure / Food Safety

SUMMARY
The walk-in cooler at station HR-C-002 triggered a high-temperature alarm at 03:47. Temperature had risen to 8.2 degrees Celsius (threshold: 7C). Alarm was received by night shift staff. Investigation found evaporator fan motor failure. Product was assessed; items above 5C for more than 2 hours were discarded per food safety protocol.

TIMELINE
03:47 - Temperature alarm activated (remote monitoring + local alarm)
03:50 - Night staff verified alarm, confirmed temperature 8.2C
03:52 - Regional on-call notified
03:55 - Staff began moving high-value product to shop refrigerators
04:15 - Refrigeration contractor dispatched
05:30 - Contractor arrived, diagnosed fan motor failure
06:45 - Replacement motor installed
07:30 - Cooler temperature returned to 4C
08:00 - Product assessment completed

PRODUCT IMPACT
- Total product in cooler: Approximately 4,200 EUR value
- Product discarded: 1,847 EUR (items held above 5C for estimated 3+ hours)
- Product saved: 2,353 EUR (moved to backup refrigeration or within safe hold time)
- Discarded items: Sandwiches, dairy, prepared salads, chilled beverages

ROOT CAUSE
Evaporator fan motor bearing failure. Motor was 6 years old. No preventive maintenance record for fan motor replacement. Ambient temperature was -2C overnight, which may have delayed temperature rise but also indicated cooling had failed several hours before alarm.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
- Evaporator fan motors: Add to preventive maintenance schedule - replace at 5 years
- Backup alarm: Verify secondary notification reaches manager (SMS was delayed 45 minutes)
- Product placement: High-value items positioned for quick removal in future
- Training: Night staff refresher on cooler alarm response

PREVENTIVE MEASURES
- All stations: Audit cooler alarm response procedures
- HR-C-002: Install backup fan alarm (redundant sensor)
- Regional: Review refrigeration maintenance contracts for PM inclusion
