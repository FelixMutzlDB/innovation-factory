INCIDENT REPORT: PUMP 3 SOLENOID FAILURE
Station: HU-BP-001 (Budapest, Arpad utca)
Date: 15 January 2025
Incident ID: INC-2025-00147
Classification: Equipment Failure / Safety Critical

SUMMARY
Pump 3 (Diesel) at station HU-BP-001 experienced E-42 solenoid valve failure at 14:23. The solenoid valve, which controls fuel flow at the dispenser, failed to close properly after a customer transaction. Staff responded correctly by taking the pump out of service immediately. No fuel spill or safety incident occurred.

TIMELINE
14:23 - Customer completed 45L diesel transaction at Pump 3
14:23 - Nozzle returned to holster; pump display showed E-42 error
14:24 - Staff observed fuel dripping from nozzle
14:24 - Staff placed pump out of service, applied absorbent to minor drip
14:25 - Station manager notified
14:35 - Maintenance contractor dispatched
16:45 - Technician arrived, confirmed solenoid failure
17:30 - Solenoid valve replaced, pump tested and returned to service

ROOT CAUSE
Post-incident inspection found the solenoid valve coil had failed. Age of component: 4 years (within typical lifespan). Possible contributing factors: electrical surge during recent storm (10 January), or normal wear. No pattern of similar failures at this station in prior 12 months.

ACTIONS TAKEN
- Pump 3 taken out of service within 2 minutes of fault detection
- Absorbent used for approximately 200ml drip - contained, no environmental impact
- Customer transaction completed successfully before fault - no customer impact
- Solenoid replaced with OEM part
- All pumps at HU-BP-001 inspected for similar wear - no issues found

LESSONS LEARNED
- Staff training on E-42 response was effective - immediate out-of-service placement prevented potential spill
- Recommendation: Add solenoid age to preventive maintenance tracking
- Consider surge protection audit for station electrical systems

FOLLOW-UP
- Station HU-BP-001: No further issues with Pump 3 as of 30 January 2025
- Maintenance contractor updated spare parts inventory at regional depot
- Incident summary shared in regional operations bulletin for staff awareness
