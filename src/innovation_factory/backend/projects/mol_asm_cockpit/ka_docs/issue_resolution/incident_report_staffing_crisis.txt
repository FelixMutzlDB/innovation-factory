Date: 2 January 2025
Incident ID: INC-2025-00152
Classification: Operations / Human Resources

SUMMARY
During the period 28 December 2024 - 1 January 2025, multiple stations experienced staffing shortages due to unplanned absences (no-shows). Peak holiday travel period coincided with minimum staffing. Three stations required emergency measures to maintain operations.

AFFECTED STATIONS AND IMPACT

Station HU-BP-001 (Budapest)
- 28 Dec: 2 no-shows (evening shift); manager covered, closed Fresh Corner 2 hours early
- 29 Dec: 1 no-show (night shift); remaining staff worked extended shift; overtime 85 EUR
- 31 Dec: 3 no-shows (day shift); regional sent 2 float staff; car wash closed

Station HR-ZG-003 (Zagreb area)
- 30 Dec: 2 no-shows (day shift); manager and assistant manager covered
- 1 Jan: 2 no-shows (morning); delayed opening by 45 minutes

Station HU-PE-008 (Pest county)
- 29 Dec: 1 no-show
- 31 Dec: 2 no-shows; closed Fresh Corner entire day; fuel only

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
- Holiday period: Staff requested time off; not all requests could be accommodated
- No-show pattern: Several staff had history of reliability issues
- Backup pool: Regional float pool understaffed during holidays
- Communication: Some staff did not notify of absence; others notified same-day

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN
- Manager coverage: All affected stations had manager on-site
- Float staff: Deployed from regional pool where available
- Service reduction: Fresh Corner, car wash closed at some stations rather than compromise safety
- Overtime: Approved for staff willing to extend
- No station closed entirely - fuel availability maintained

FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS
- Disciplinary: No-show staff subject to performance review
- Scheduling: Holiday 2025 - require confirmation 48 hours before shift
- Float pool: Recruit additional float staff for peak periods
- Incentive: Holiday shift premium under review for 2025
- Cross-training: Ensure more staff trained on Fresh Corner to enable flexible coverage

LESSONS LEARNED
- Holiday scheduling: Build in 15% buffer for no-shows during peak periods
- Communication protocol: Mandatory check-in 24 hours before holiday shift
- Escalation: Clear criteria for when to reduce services vs. seek emergency coverage
- Documentation: All no-shows logged for pattern analysis

COST IMPACT
- Overtime: 340 EUR
- Lost sales (reduced services): Estimated 1,200 EUR
- Float staff travel: 120 EUR
- No customer complaints regarding fuel availability
