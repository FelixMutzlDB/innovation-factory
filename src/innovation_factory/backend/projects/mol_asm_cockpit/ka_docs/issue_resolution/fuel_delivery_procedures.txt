Document Version: 2.3 | Last Updated: January 2025

OVERVIEW
Proper fuel delivery procedures ensure product quality, accurate inventory, and regulatory compliance. All deliveries must be verified before acceptance. Incorrect procedures have led to contamination incidents and inventory discrepancies.

PRE-DELIVERY CHECKLIST
- Verify delivery scheduled in ASM Cockpit
- Ensure receiving tank has sufficient ullage (minimum 10% headspace for expansion)
- Check tank level via ATG - record pre-delivery reading
- Clear access to tank fill point; no vehicles blocking
- Spill kit and absorbent materials available
- Delivery driver has valid credentials and delivery documentation

DELIVERY ACCEPTANCE PROCEDURE

Step 1: Driver Identification
- Verify driver matches delivery order
- Check tanker placards match product (diesel, gasoline, premium)
- Confirm tanker is from approved supplier (ASM approved list in Cockpit)

Step 2: Documentation Review
- Delivery note: Product type, volume, temperature (if applicable)
- Certificate of quality: Within validity period
- Previous compartment: Ensure tanker was last used for same product type (or properly cleaned)

Step 3: Visual Inspection
- Tanker exterior: No obvious damage or leaks
- Hose and connections: Clean, no contamination
- Sample draw: Driver should provide sample from compartment - check for water, sediment, unusual odor

Step 4: Connection and Delivery
- Attach hose to correct fill point - VERIFY TANK ID
- Common error: Delivery to wrong tank - double-check before opening valve
- Monitor throughout delivery - staff must remain present
- Observe for leaks, overflow, unusual sounds

Step 5: Post-Delivery Verification
- Record final tank level via ATG
- Calculate received volume: Post-reading minus pre-reading
- Compare to delivery note - variance up to 0.5% acceptable
- If variance exceeds 0.5%: Do not sign delivery note; contact supplier and regional office
- Sign delivery note only after verification complete

QUALITY CHECKS
- Diesel: Visual check for water (hazy appearance); sample in clear container - water settles at bottom
- Gasoline: Check for phase separation if ethanol blend; unusual odor may indicate contamination
- Document any quality concerns; reject delivery if contamination suspected
- Retain sample for 7 days in case of dispute - label with date, product, delivery note number

TANK MONITORING POST-DELIVERY
- ATG reading should stabilize within 2 hours
- Run leak test if required by local regulation (typically within 4 hours)
- Reconcile delivery in ASM Cockpit within 24 hours
- Report any anomaly to inventory control

INCIDENT: WRONG TANK DELIVERY
If delivery made to wrong tank: Immediately stop delivery. Do not dispense from affected tank. Isolate product. Contact regional office and supplier. Professional assessment required before tank can be used. Document fully. Reference incident_report_fuel_quality_complaint.txt for investigation procedure.
