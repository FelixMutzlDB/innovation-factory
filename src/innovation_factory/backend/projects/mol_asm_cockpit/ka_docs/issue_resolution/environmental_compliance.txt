ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES
ASM Cockpit Service Station Network
Document Version: 1.9 | Regulatory: EU and National Requirements

OVERVIEW
Service stations handle hazardous materials (fuel, oils, cleaning chemicals) and must comply with environmental regulations. Non-compliance results in fines, operational restrictions, and reputational damage. This document covers spill response, waste management, and reporting obligations.

FUEL SPILL CLEANUP

Minor Spill (less than 5 liters, contained)
1. Stop source of spill immediately
2. Prevent spread: Use absorbent materials, do not flush with water
3. Absorbents: Use fuel-specific pads or granules; avoid sawdust (not effective for fuel)
4. Place used absorbents in designated hazardous waste container
5. Clean affected surface with detergent; collect wash water - do not allow to enter drainage
6. Document: Spill log, volume, cause, corrective action
7. Report to station manager; no regulatory report typically required for minor contained spills

Major Spill (greater than 5 liters, or entering drainage/environment)
1. Stop source - isolate tank, close valves
2. Evacuate area if vapor concentration high
3. Call emergency services: 112 (EU emergency number)
4. Notify environmental authority per local requirement (typically within 1-2 hours)
5. Prevent entry to drainage: Block drains, use absorbent booms
6. Do not attempt full cleanup - professional remediation required
7. Document everything: Photos, timeline, actions taken
8. Preserve area for investigation

Spill Kit Requirements
- Each station: Minimum 50L capacity spill kit at forecourt
- Contents: Absorbent pads, granules, booms, PPE (gloves, goggles), containment barriers

- Cleaning chemicals: Per SDS; some hazardous
- Fluorescent tubes, batteries: Separate collection

Waste Storage

- Secondary containment for liquid waste
- Secure area - not accessible to public
- Inventory log: Waste out = waste in minus sold/used

Disposal Procedure
- Use only licensed waste contractors (approved list in ASM Cockpit)
- Waste transfer note required for each collection
- Retain documentation 3 years minimum (5 years in some jurisdictions)

Non-Hazardous Waste
- General waste: Municipal collection
- Recyclables: Separate streams per local program
- Food waste: Composting or organic waste collection where available

ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTING

Mandatory Reports
- Spill report: Per local regulation - typically any spill to environment
- Annual waste report: Quantities by category
- Tank integrity: Per UST regulation
- Discharge permits: If applicable to station
