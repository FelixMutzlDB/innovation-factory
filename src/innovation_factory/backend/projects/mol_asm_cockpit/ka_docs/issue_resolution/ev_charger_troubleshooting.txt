ASM Cockpit Service Station Network
Document Version: 1.7 | Equipment: ABB Terra, Alpitronic Hypercharger, Kempower

OVERVIEW
EV charging stations are deployed at 45 ASM stations as of Q1 2025. Chargers require different troubleshooting than fuel dispensers. Most issues can be resolved by station staff; complex faults require certified EV technician.

COMMON ERROR CODES AND MEANINGS

ABB Terra AC/DC Chargers
- E001: Communication error - charger cannot reach backend; check network connection
- E002: Ground fault - safety shutdown; do not attempt reset; contact technician
- E003: Overcurrent - cable or connector fault; inspect for damage
- E004: Temperature fault - charger overheated; allow 30 min cooldown, then retry
- E005: Payment terminal fault - customer cannot complete transaction; process payment manually if possible

Alpitronic Hypercharger
- F0: General fault - power cycle required
- F1: DC contactor fault - technician required
- F2: Insulation fault - do not use; cordon off; technician required
- F3: Emergency stop activated - release E-stop button, power cycle
- F4: Cable fault - inspect cable and connector for damage

Kempower
- 0x1001: Charging cable not connected properly - reseat connector
- 0x1002: Vehicle communication error - try different cable or vehicle
- 0x2001: Grid fault - utility issue; report to network operator
- 0x3001: Internal error - power cycle; if persists, technician

RESET PROCEDURES

Standard Power Cycle
1. Ensure no vehicle connected
2. Open charger cabinet (if staff access) or use emergency stop to interrupt
3. Locate main circuit breaker - switch off
4. Wait 2 minutes (allows capacitor discharge)
5. Switch breaker on
6. Charger will boot - typically 3-5 minutes
7. Verify status LED shows ready/available

Remote Reset (if available)
- ASM Cockpit: Charger management > Select unit > Remote reset
- Only use when no physical fault visible
- Do not remote reset if error indicates ground fault or cable damage

CUSTOMER SUPPORT PROTOCOL
1. Verify customer has compatible vehicle (CCS, CHAdeMO, or Type 2 per charger type)
2. Ensure customer has activated payment method (app or RFID)
3. Guide through connection: Plug in before initiating charge (most units)
4. If charge does not start: Try alternate charger at station
5. Document charger ID, error code, vehicle make/model for support ticket
6. Provide customer with 24/7 EV support number: +36 800 123 456

SAFETY REMINDERS
- Never touch charging cable or connector during active charging
- Do not use charger if cable appears damaged, cracked, or has exposed wiring
- In case of smoke or unusual odor: Activate E-stop, evacuate area, call emergency services
- EV fires: Use Class D extinguisher if available; otherwise maintain distance, let fire services handle

MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE
- Weekly: Visual inspection of cables, connectors, display screens
- Monthly: Clean connector contacts with approved contact cleaner
- Quarterly: Certified technician inspection
- Cable replacement: Per manufacturer schedule or when wear detected
