POS SYSTEM TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
ASM Cockpit Service Station Network
Document Version: 3.1 | Last Updated: February 2025

SYSTEM OVERVIEW
The ASM network uses Verifone Commander and NCR Radiant POS terminals integrated with the central back-office system. Terminals process fuel, shop, and car wash transactions. Payment processing runs through Ingenico payment terminals with PCI-DSS compliant encryption.

TERMINAL CRASH RECOVERY

Immediate Response (Terminal Unresponsive)
1. Do not power cycle immediately - wait 60 seconds for automatic recovery
2. If frozen on transaction screen: Note transaction amount and customer details
3. Power cycle: Unplug power cable, wait 15 seconds, reconnect
4. Boot sequence typically takes 2-3 minutes
5. Upon restart: Check if transaction was completed (review pending transactions in back-office)
6. If transaction incomplete: Process manually or advise customer to retry

Forced Restart Procedure
- Hold power button 10 seconds for soft reset
- If no response: Physical power disconnect required
- After restart: Verify network connectivity (green status on terminal)
- Run diagnostic: Menu > System > Diagnostics > Connection Test

PAYMENT PROCESSING ISSUES

Card Declined - Customer Insists Card Valid
1. Verify card is inserted correctly (chip) or swiped fully
2. Try alternate payment terminal if station has multiple
3. Check terminal for specific decline code: 05 (Do not honor), 51 (Insufficient funds), 54 (Expired card)
4. For fleet cards: Verify station is in network; check card status with fleet provider
5. Never advise customer of specific decline reason - refer to "contact your bank"

Transaction Timeout
- Typically caused by network latency or gateway congestion
- Wait 2 minutes - transaction may complete asynchronously
- Do NOT run duplicate transaction without verifying first transaction failed
- Check ASM Cockpit for pending authorization before retry

Receipt Printer Failure
- Open printer door, remove jammed paper
- Verify paper roll is thermal type, correct orientation
- Clean print head with dry cloth (no solvents)
- If printer hardware fault: Use manual receipt book, log transaction number

COMMON POS ERRORS
ERR-204: Database sync failure - terminal will retry automatically; if persistent, contact IT support
ERR-311: Price update failed - verify price file was received; manual price entry may be required
ERR-402: Fuel authorization timeout - pump may have dispensed; reconcile with tank readings

BACK-OFFICE RECONCILIATION
End-of-day reconciliation must balance. If POS crash occurred during shift:
1. Export transaction log from terminal
2. Cross-reference with pump totals
3. Document variance in shift report
4. Escalate discrepancies over 50 EUR to regional office

PREVENTIVE MEASURES
- Daily: Verify all terminals communicating before shift start
- Weekly: Clear transaction log archive (retain 90 days minimum)
- Monthly: Update terminal software per IT schedule
- Ensure adequate ventilation - POS terminals overheated in 3 incidents during summer 2025
