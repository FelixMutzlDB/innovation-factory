OVERVIEW
Effective inventory management balances availability with capital efficiency. Overstocking ties up capital and increases spoilage risk; understocking loses sales and damages customer satisfaction. This guide covers fuel and shop inventory optimization.

FUEL INVENTORY

Tank Level Optimization
- Minimum level: Maintain 20% of tank capacity to avoid runout and allow delivery acceptance
- Reorder point: Trigger delivery request when tank reaches 25-30% (allows lead time)
- Maximum level: Do not exceed 95% - allows for expansion, delivery variance
- High-volume tanks: More frequent smaller deliveries vs. large infrequent - reduces capital

Delivery Scheduling
- Predict demand: Use historical data, seasonal factors, local events
- Avoid weekend delivery when possible (premium charges)
- Coordinate with supplier - consolidated deliveries reduce cost
- Document: All deliveries reconciled in ASM Cockpit within 24 hours

Variance Investigation
- Fuel variance over 0.3%: Investigate within 48 hours
- Causes: Calibration drift, leak, delivery discrepancy, theft
- Tank chart verification: Annual calibration per tank_calibration_procedures.txt

SHOP INVENTORY

Stock Level Optimization
- Fast movers: Maintain 5-7 days stock (beverages, tobacco, snacks)
- Medium movers: 3-5 days stock
- Slow movers: 1-2 weeks or consider delisting
- Fresh Corner: Per bakery_ordering_optimization.txt and hot_dog_planner_guide.txt

Replenishment
- Order frequency: Match supplier delivery schedule
- Lead time: Factor into reorder point
- Minimum order: Optimize to avoid excess; some suppliers have MOQ
- Seasonal: Build ahead for peak (summer, holidays) - see seasonal_operations_guide.txt

SPOILAGE REDUCTION
- FIFO: First in, first out - always
- Date checks: Daily for short-life items
- Storage: Correct temperature, dry goods protected from moisture
- Damaged goods: Remove immediately, document, claim if supplier responsibility
- Target: Shop spoilage below 1.5% of cost of goods sold

INVENTORY COUNT
- Full count: Quarterly minimum; monthly for high-value stations
- Cycle count: Weekly count of subset; rotate through categories
- Variance: Investigate over 1% by value
- Fuel: Continuous via ATG; physical dip if ATG variance

SHRINKAGE CONTROL
- Theft: Security measures, staff awareness
- Administrative: Accurate receiving, correct pricing
- Damage: Proper handling, storage
- Document: All shrinkage in ASM Cockpit; trend analysis

ASM COCKPIT UTILIZATION
- Demand forecasting: Use Cockpit analytics for order recommendations
- Variance reporting: Automated alerts for out-of-range
- Supplier performance: Track delivery accuracy, lead time
- Benchmark: Compare to peer stations for improvement ideas
