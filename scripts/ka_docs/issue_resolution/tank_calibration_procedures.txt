UNDERGROUND FUEL TANK CALIBRATION AND INSPECTION PROCEDURES
ASM Cockpit Service Station Network
Document Version: 1.8 | Effective: January 2025

REGULATORY CONTEXT
Underground storage tanks (USTs) must comply with national environmental regulations and ASM internal standards. Calibration ensures inventory accuracy, leak detection reliability, and reconciliation with fuel delivery records. Non-compliance may result in regulatory penalties and operational disruptions.

CALIBRATION FREQUENCY
- Full calibration: Annually, or after tank modification, or when variance exceeds 0.5%
- Partial verification: Quarterly for high-volume tanks (greater than 50,000L monthly throughput)
- Post-delivery verification: Within 4 hours of each fuel delivery

PRE-CALIBRATION REQUIREMENTS
1. Schedule during low-traffic period (recommended: 02:00-05:00)
2. Ensure tank has been static (no dispensing or delivery) for minimum 2 hours
3. Verify tank probe is functional and communicating
4. Have calibration chart from tank manufacturer available
5. Notify station manager and document in shift log

CALIBRATION PROCEDURE (WATER DROP METHOD)
Step 1: Measure tank contents using automatic tank gauge (ATG) - record reading
Step 2: Add known volume of water (typically 100L) to tank via designated fill point
Step 3: Wait 15 minutes for stabilization
Step 4: Record new ATG reading
Step 5: Calculate variance: (Expected increase - Actual increase) / Expected increase x 100
Step 6: If variance exceeds 0.3%, recalibration of probe required
Step 7: Document all readings on Tank Calibration Form TC-001

INSPECTION CHECKLIST
- Tank sump: Check for water accumulation, fuel sheen, debris
- Spill bucket: Verify empty, no cracks, gasket integrity
- Overfill prevention: Test alarm at 90% capacity
- Cathodic protection: Annual test for steel tanks (if applicable)
- Piping: Visual inspection for corrosion, loose fittings
- Manway: Verify secure, gasket intact

COMMON CALIBRATION ISSUES
Variance consistently high: Probe may be damaged, bent, or coated with debris. Professional cleaning or replacement required.
Erratic readings: Check for water in tank (phase separation), verify probe cable integrity.
Delivery reconciliation failure: Verify delivery ticket volume matches ATG increase; check for line leak or wrong tank delivery.

STATION-SPECIFIC NOTES
Station HU-BP-001: Tank 2 (Diesel) requires quarterly calibration due to 85,000L monthly volume. Tank 3 (Premium) has historical variance - monitor closely.
Station HR-C-002: All tanks upgraded 2024 - new calibration baseline established November 2024.

DOCUMENTATION
All calibration results must be uploaded to ASM Cockpit within 48 hours. Retain paper records for 7 years per regulatory requirement.
